J.A.R.V.I.S
===========

This is my set of dotfiles, shell scripts, environment tweaks and related stuff.

J.A.R.V.I.S is in an early stage of development, and in constant change, thus things here may be a
litle chaotic and not granted to work right.

Tested on OSX 10.8 only; some tool may not work on Linux environments.

This 'thing' is provided AS IS, so use at our own risk; it is published under the terms of the
**DWTFYWWTS** (Do What the Fuck You Want with This Shit) license.
